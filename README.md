# Shakespearean_Recommender_System_PCA_Kmeans
William Shakespeare is considered one of the greatest playwrights in the English language. He is attributed with 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and other works. Even 400 years later, his writings are still be studied in most high schools and colleges in the US and elsewhere. Shakespeareâ€™s complete works are available online at http://shakespeare.mit.edu/. 

In this exercise I use PySpark in conjunction with unsupervised learning techniques in order to derive insights on a data set containing quotes from Shakespeare characters. Shakespeare has always fascinated me, which is why I found it meaningful to seek out similarities between the different characters he's written. The first portion of this exercise consists of creating a Shakespearean character recommender system which is capable of recommending new characters which are similar to a speicific character of interest. I also make use of PCA inference to find important words in character quotes. In the second part of the repository I perform K-Means clustering to try and find insights about characters.
